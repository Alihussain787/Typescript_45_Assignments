/* Q15 Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner,
so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

• Start with your program from Exercise 14.
Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

• Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it
with the name of the new person you are inviting.

• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.*/

// let guest = ["Ali","Khaleel","Farhan"];

// console.log(`Dear ${guest[0]} please come to dinner.`);
// console.log(`Dear ${guest[1]} please come to dinner.`);
// console.log(`Dear ${guest[2]} please come to dinner.`);

// console.log(`${guest[1]} can not come to dinner`);

// let replacing = guest.splice(1,1,"Aliza");// replace new guest in the list
// for(let i = 0; i < guest.length; i++){
//     console.log(`Dear ${guest[i]} please come to dinner`);
// }
